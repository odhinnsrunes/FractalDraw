FractalDraw
===========

FractalDraw is currently Beta software so it may not work as intended.

It's a utility for drawing fractal shorelines and rivers.  
It's intended to be used for mapping for roleplaying games or other creative cartography uses.

It's not intended to be a complete mapping program.  Instead, it is designed to export SVG files
that can be edited in otehr programs like InkScape: http://inkscape.org or Adobe Illustrator.


Installation
============

Binaries can be downloaded for MacOS and Windows at: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/txcy9sog7u7kosj/rsyRZIQyqw

In Windows, just run the FractalDraw-x.x.x.exe setup file.

In MacOS, open the FractalDraw-x.x.x.dmg file and drag FractalDraw.app into the Applications 
folder and run it from there.

At the moment, Binaries are only available for MacOS and Windows, but it should be able to be 
built and run on any platform supported by Qt 5.

Use
===

There are several color selectors fro selecting the working colors and the color of the last item drawn.

You can choose to draw fractal polygons or fractal lines.

Polygons can be used for continents, islands or lakes, etc.  Lines can be used for rivers or roads, etc. 

Use the space bar while drawing a fractal line or part of a fractal polygon to change it's random shape.

You can undo, save and load FractalDraw files, export to SVG and restore the default colors from the menus.

You can also determine whether the background, polygon outlines and polygon fill are drawn.

Building from Source
====================

Fractal Draw requires Qt 5.0 or higher to build: http://qt-project.org

To create the setup file for Windows, it requires Inno Setup Compiler: http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php
